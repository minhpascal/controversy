      "full": "In the usual cancer biopsy, a surgeon cuts out a piece of the patient\u2019s tumor, but researchers in labs across the country are now testing a potentially transformative innovation. They call it the liquid biopsy, and it is a blood test that has only recently become feasible with the latest exquisitely sensitive techniques. It is showing promise in finding tiny snippets of cancer DNA in a patient\u2019s blood. The hope is that a simple blood draw \u2014 far less onerous for patients than a traditional biopsy or a CT scan \u2014 will enable oncologists to quickly figure out whether a treatment is working and, if it is, to continue monitoring the treatment in case the cancer develops resistance. Failing treatments could be abandoned quickly, sparing patients grueling side effects and allowing doctors to try alternatives. \u201cThis could change forever the way we follow up not only response to treatments but also the emergence of resistance, and down the line could even be used for really early diagnosis,\u201d said Dr. Jos\u00e9 Baselga, physician in chief and chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Researchers caution that more evaluations of the test\u2019s accuracy and reliability are needed. So far, there have been only small studies in particular cancers, including lung, colon and blood cancer. But early results are encouraging. A National Cancer Institute study published this month in The Lancet Oncology, involving 126 patients with the most common form of lymphoma, found the test predicted recurrences more than three months before they were noticeable on CT scans. The liquid biopsies also identified patients unlikely to respond to therapy. Oncologists who are not using the new test say they are looking on with fascination. \u201cOur lab doesn\u2019t do it, but we are very interested,\u201d said Dr. Levi Garraway of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a top priority.\u201d Researchers are finding out things about individuals\u2019 cancers that astonish them. MarySusan Sabini, a fifth-grade teacher from Gardiner, N.Y., has lung cancer that resisted two attempts at chemotherapy and a round of radiation. Her doctors at Sloan Kettering saw cancer DNA in her blood when she began taking an experimental drug in October that was her last hope. Four days later, the cancer DNA shards had vanished, a sign, the doctors hoped, that the treatment was working. But they dared not tell her the good tidings. The blood test itself was so new they were afraid to rely on it. Within weeks, Ms. Sabini began to breathe easier. Months later, she had a CT scan, an X-ray test that uses a computer to assemble detailed images of slices of tumor tissue. It confirmed her tumors were shrinking. \u201cEvery cancer has a mutation that can be followed with this method,\u201d said Dr. David Hyman, the oncologist at Sloan Kettering who is leading the study of the experimental drug Ms. Sabini takes. \u201cIt is like bar coding the cancer in the blood.\u201d The idea for the test grew out of a discovery made years ago about fetuses: They shed little pieces of DNA into the bloodstreams of mothers-to-be. It turned out that all growing cells, including tumors, shed tiny DNA fragments. But finding those minuscule bits of DNA, floating in a sea of other molecules, is not easy. They remain in circulation for just a couple of hours before they are metabolized. And the detection method became useful only when cancer researchers, using advanced methods for DNA sequencing, found hundreds of mutations that could serve as bar codes for cancers and developed the technology for finding a snippet of DNA. The standard methods of assessing a treatment\u2019s effectiveness have serious drawbacks. Doctors routinely monitor patients for symptoms like pain or shortness of breath, but some people do not have any. In those who do, it can take time for such symptoms to wane \u2014 the tumor can die, but the body has to heal. Patients often have scans to determine if tumors are shrinking, but it can take weeks or months before a tumor looks smaller on a scan, in part because a scan shows not just the cancer but also connective tissue, immune system cells and scars at the site. Doctors can be fooled into thinking a tumor is present when, in fact, it is gone. \u201cWhen you are treating a patient \u2014 and we see this many times \u2014 your treatment is quite effective but there is some residual lesion on a scan,\u201d Dr. Hyman said. \u201cYou take the patient to surgery for a biopsy, and all you see is scar tissue. There is no visible cancer there.\u201d The blood tests also allow frequent monitoring of tumors as they spread and mutate or develop resistance to treatment. The only other way to know is with biopsies. \u201cI cannot do a weekly liver biopsy and see how things are going,\u201d Dr. Baselga said. \u201cBut I can do a blood test every week.\u201d Another possible application \u2014 early diagnosis of cancer \u2014 is trickier. If a blood test showed cancer DNA, what would that mean? Where is the tumor, and would it help to find and treat it early? Some cancers stop growing or go away on their own. With others, the outcome is just as good if the cancer is found later. One early use for DNA blood tests may be helping doctors decide which patients with Stage 2 colon cancer need chemotherapy. Eighty percent of patients with these large tumors that have not spread outside the colon are cured by surgery alone; the rest have recurrences. Six months of intense chemotherapy reduces the risk the cancer will return, but there is no way to predict who needs the treatment. Two Australian scientists, working with Dr. Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins, wondered if a cancer DNA blood test might be predictive. They began with a study of 250 patients, looking for cancer DNA in blood after surgery. The tumors recurred in 80 percent of those with cancer DNA in their blood but only 6 to 8 percent of those whose blood did not have detectable cancer DNA. Now the Australian researchers, Dr. Jeanne Tie and Dr. Peter Gibbs of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, are starting a study of 450 patients randomly assigned to have the blood test or not. Those who have it will get chemotherapy if the test finds cancer DNA. Those who do not have the blood test will get usual care, whatever their physician prescribes. The patients will be told their blood test results, although the investigators worry how some will react. \u201cIf you find DNA and tell the patient there is a very high risk of recurrence, that creates a lot of anxiety,\u201d Dr. Gibbs said. \u201cAnd we are not sure chemotherapy will be helpful.\u201d The blood test, they hope, will answer that question. \u201cThis will be the first real test of whether circulating tumor DNA can be clinically useful,\u201d Dr. Vogelstein said.",

      "abstract": "Case brought by European antitrust chief Margrethe Vetager against Gazprom will inevitably be test of geopolitical wills between Russia and West, which is illustrated by fact that Gazprom's response casts itself as effectively arm of Russian government; experts believe that European Commission has stronger hand in terms of antitrust law and economic leverage.",
      "author": "By JAMES KANTER",
      "full": "BRUSSELS \u2014 European antitrust regulators on Wednesday charged the Russian energy giant Gazprom with abusing its dominance in natural gas markets, a move amounting to a direct challenge to the authorities in Moscow. The antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, took pains to describe the matter in terms of business markets. But the case cannot help but be a test of geopolitical wills, given the tension between Russia and the West over the Kremlin\u2019s involvement in the Ukraine crisis. Gazprom\u2019s immediate response seemed aimed at elevating the issue to a matter of international relations. Gazprom suggested that it was not subject to the European Union\u2019s antitrust jurisdiction because it is a state-controlled company. It signaled it was effectively an arm of the Russian government, \u201cempowered by the laws of the Russian Federation with special socially significant functions\u201d and with \u201cthe status of a strategic government-controlled business entity.\u201d In terms of antitrust law, many experts see the European Commission as having an upper hand, along with significant economic leverage. Gazprom, they say, despite its market dominance, may need European customers even more than Europe needs its gas. That is because changes in the global energy market in the last year have weakened Gazprom financially, while also creating more potential alternative sources of supply. The European Union is \u201cin a stronger position to take on Gazprom than it has been before\u201d said Christopher J. Weafer, a senior partner at Macro-Advisory, a Moscow-based business consulting firm. He noted, for example, that gas production in Azerbaijan would be coming online at the end of this decade. And he cited the potential of gas from Iran, if sanctions against that country were lifted. Iran has gas reserves comparable to Russia\u2019s. Europe \u201cseems intent on putting a cap on Gazprom\u2019s position,\u201d Mr. Weafer said. \u201cThey can do that.\u201d Gazprom could eventually face a fine theoretically running higher than 10 billion euros, or about $10.7 billion. But the larger worry for Gazprom is the prospect of being forced to allow more competition in markets it has long controlled. Mr. Weafer said that one of the few levers Gazprom might have in opposing the antitrust case would be to refuse new contracts to European customers, but that \u201cthat would be pretty much cutting off their nose to spite their face.\u201d Specifically, the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, said that unfair pricing might have resulted in higher gas prices in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland \u2014 countries that have long been wholly or substantially dependent on Russian gas. In those countries, the commission said, Gazprom was suspected of charging wholesalers prices that were significantly higher compared with the company\u2019s costs or to benchmark prices. The commission also suspects Gazprom of quashing competition by restricting gas flows to some parts of Europe. Gazprom seems to be \u201cpursuing an overall strategy to partition Central and Eastern European gas markets, for example by reducing its customers\u2019 ability to resell the gas cross-border,\u201d the commission said in a statement. Ms. Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner said, \u201cKeeping national gas markets separate also allowed Gazprom to charge prices that we, at this stage, consider to be unfair.\u201d \u201dIf our concerns were confirmed,\u201d she said, \u201cGazprom would have to face the legal consequences of its behavior.\u201d The commission also said that Gazprom might have been leveraging its powerful market position in Bulgaria and Poland by making supplies of gas conditional on those countries\u2019 agreeing to participate in pipeline projects to carry even more Russian gas into Europe. The commission, which described its case but did not publicly share the formal \u201cstatement of objections\u201d it had sent to Gazprom, indicated that it suspected the Russian company of strong-arming Poland and Bulgaria. Poland operates a pipeline called Yamal in a joint venture with Gazprom. The commission said Gazprom had made gas supplies conditional upon maintaining its control over investment decisions for the pipeline. \u201cThis pipeline is one of the main infrastructures that could allow gas from suppliers \u2014 other than Gazprom \u2014 to enter the Polish market,\u2019\u2019 the commission said. Bulgaria had agreed to be the landing point for a planned Black Sea pipeline called South Stream, before resistance from Brussels prompted Russia to suspend that plan last year. The commission said Gazprom had made wholesale gas supplies conditional upon Bulgaria\u2019s agreeing to participate in South Stream, \u201cdespite high costs and an uncertain economic outlook.\u201d Bulgarian officials did not immediately respond to questions. A Polish diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said that a greater degree of scrutiny should be required in such arrangements when the \u201cbargaining position of wholesalers vis-\u00e0-vis a dominant supplier is weak.\u201d Gazprom said in a statement that it \u201cconsiders the objections put forward by the European Commission to be unfounded.\u201d The company added that it \u201cstrictly adheres to all the norms of international law and national legislation\u201d and that its pricing policies \u201care in full conformity with the standards observed by other producers and exporters of natural gas.\u201d The regulators\u2019 move is a frontal challenge to President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s economic and geopolitical strategy by potentially limiting Russia\u2019s ability to set prices favoring some customers and penalizing others. President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania, the country that called most vigorously for formal charges, said, \u201cThe decision is a strong signal to consumers and the market that rules apply to everyone.\u201d \u201dThe era of Kremlin-backed political and economic blackmail draws to a close,\u201d said Ms. Grybauskaite, who also called for \u201cswift and conclusive\u201d results in the case. One analyst said a quick result in the case looked unlikely, particularly since Gazprom had insisted on its importance as a strategic entity of the Russian government. \u201dI do not expect the government in Moscow to send someone to negotiate directly with Brussels as that would recognize the authority of the European Commission in these matters,\u201d said Sijbren de Jong, an energy expert with the Hague Center for Strategic Studies, a research organization. \u201cGazprom and Moscow are going to do everything they can to continue to deal with national governments, rather recognize the primacy of Brussels over whom Gazprom deals with, and how,\u201d Mr. de Jong said. But some antitrust lawyers said Gazprom, and potentially its Kremlin backers, might have little choice but to deal with the European Commission in Brussels. Procedurally, the company has 12 weeks to respond to the commission\u2019s charges. \u201dGazprom has suggested since the start of this case that antitrust should not apply, given that it\u2019s one of Russia\u2019s strategic entities,\u201d said Anne MacGregor, who is special counsel in Brussels at the law firm Cadwalader. \u201cBut that does not cut much ice with Brussels.\u201d \u201dMany non-E.U. companies have been found in breach of the Union\u2019s competition rules in the past,\u201d Ms. MacGregor said. \u201cGazprom has subsidiaries established in the Union, and some of these were the subject of surprise raids by the commission back in 2011 when the case began. \u201dIf you are doing business in Europe, then it really does not matter where you are from or who you are,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou still must comply with E.U. rules.\u201d Gazprom has previously sparred with the commission, more than a decade ago. In those disputes, over its contracts in Western Europe, Gazprom agreed to fundamental changes without paying fines. In a series of settlements from 2003 to 2005, the commission ensured that companies including Eni of Italy, OMV of Austria and Ruhrgas of Germany would no longer be prevented from reselling gas to buyers in other countries. But that was in a period when Russia was not engaged in military activity in Ukraine or the target of Western economic sanctions. This time, predicted Mr. Weafer, the Macro-Advisory analyst, there will be a considerable amount of political bluster from the Russian government. \u201cThe Kremlin,\u201d he said, \u201cis going to complain about this in fairly clear terms.\u201d",

      "abstract": "Iowa water utility Des Moines Water Works has filed suit against leaders of three counties, seeking to make farmers comply with federal cleanwater standards for nitrate runoff in bid to protect drinking water supply fed by Raccoon River; farmers call suit confrontational approach that hinders progress and discounts voluntary changes being made by farmers.",
      "author": "By MITCH SMITH",
      "full": "MANSON, Iowa \u2014  The flat, endless acres of black dirt here in northern Iowa will soon be filled with corn and soybean seeds. But as farmers tuned up their tractors and waited for the perfect moment to plant, another topic weighed on their minds: a lawsuit filed in federal court by the state\u2019s largest water utility. After years of mounting frustration, the utility, Des Moines Water Works, sued the leaders of three rural Iowa counties last month. Too little has been done, the lawsuit says, to prevent nitrates from flowing out of farm fields into the Raccoon River and, eventually, into the drinking water supply for roughly 500,000 Iowans. The suit seeks to make farmers comply with federal clean-water standards for nitrates that apply to factories and commercial users, and requests unspecified damages. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me that traditional, industrial agriculture has no real interest in taking the steps that are necessary to radically change their operations in a way that will protect our drinking water,\u201d said Bill Stowe, the chief executive of Des Moines Water Works. High nitrate runoff, which can result from nitrogen-rich soil and applied fertilizer, places Des Moines\u2019s drinking water in danger of violating federal quality standards, Mr. Stowe said, and increases costs and poses health risks for customers. The lawsuit raises not only the legal question of whether the government should regulate the water that drains off farmers\u2019 land, but also the existential issue of whether rural and urban Iowans can collaborate to solve vexing problems. In a state where agriculture drives the economy, grain silos are featured on license plates and people pride themselves on a certain brand of \u201cIowa nice,\u201d farmers like Brent Johnson have criticized the litigation as an antagonistic overreach that comes at the expense of cooperation and neighborliness. \u201cIt\u2019s a confrontational approach,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who farms corn and soybeans here in Calhoun County, one of three counties whose boards of supervisors were named as defendants in the lawsuit. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a lot of progress made. I don\u2019t know any farmer who wants to increase nitrates in the river.\u201d The nitrate issue is, in many ways, an unfortunate side effect of one of Iowa\u2019s great assets: the nutrient-rich dirt that makes for some of the world\u2019s most productive cropland. Though that nitrogen-filled soil helps Mr. Johnson and others grow prodigious amounts of corn and soybeans, a significant rainstorm can wash many of those nutrients, along with nitrates applied as fertilizer, into tributaries of the Raccoon River. The Raccoon is one of two rivers that provide drinking water for Des Moines, the state\u2019s capital and urban center. Notably, most everyone involved agrees that the nitrates in the water supply are a problem, and that farmers can play a role in solving it. But while Mr. Stowe and the utility want to hold farmers to strict federal water quality standards, Mr. Johnson and the state\u2019s powerful agricultural groups favor a voluntary system. Last year, months before the lawsuit was filed, the state associations for corn, soybean and pork producers formed the Iowa Agriculture Water Alliance, which bills itself as a farmer-led effort to improve water quality. The group\u2019s executive director, Sean McMahon, said that many farmers were eager to employ conservation practices, but that education and time were needed to see more results. Money, he said, would be better spent on outreach and cost-sharing programs than on lawyers for the lawsuit. Leaders of other agricultural associations expressed similar sentiments, while saying they still appreciated the urgency of the problem. \u201cWe need to scale it up,\u201d said Roger Wolf, director of environmental programs and services for the Iowa Soybean Association. \u201cWe know that.\u201d Mr. Johnson, whose family has worked these fields for more than 100 years, says he and his neighbors care deeply about the land and understand the concerns raised in the lawsuit. On his property, Mr. Johnson uses a limited-tilling method, and he has planted rows of switch grass on the edge of one field and has filled wetlands with native grasses. Experts say those tactics can help keep nutrients in the field and out of the water system. Mr. Johnson, who serves on the county soil and water conservation commission, made those changes on his own. He said he feared that the lawsuit, if successful, would add a regulatory burden just as many farmers were making voluntary changes. \u201cThat\u2019s not healthy for agriculture, I don\u2019t think, to take the voluntary out,\u201d he said. In Des Moines, Mr. Stowe said years of encouraging changes through voluntary programs had simply not brought about significant results. Nitrate levels in the Raccoon River remain stubbornly high, which required the utility to run its nitrate removal facilities for three months last winter, a rarity. In 2013, he said, Des Moines was barely able to remove nitrates quickly enough to keep up with demand, and nearly violated federal regulations. Just last Thursday, the utility turned its nitrate removal tanks back on, citing high levels of runoff upstream. However the issue is addressed, there are costs. Mr. Johnson\u2019s conservation practices required taking land out of production, potentially reducing profits at harvest time. For Des Moines Water Works, operating the tanks that remove nitrates is expensive. The lawsuit, filed in federal court for\u00a0the Northern District of Iowa, names the boards of supervisors in Buena Vista and Sac Counties, along with the board in Calhoun County, as defendants, saying they are responsible for overseeing drainage districts that have allowed nitrate-heavy water to make its way into rivers. Water with excessive nitrates can cause serious health problems, especially in infants, and some environmental groups, including the\u00a0Iowa Environmental Council\u00a0and the\u00a0Sierra Club\u2019s Iowa chapter, have expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of voluntary reductions. Individual farmers\u2019 efforts and anecdotal reports of success, Mr. Stowe said, have not been enough to counter others\u2019 reluctance to make major changes. At this point, he said, collaboration with agricultural groups would have to come in addition to regulation, not instead of it. \u201cTalking the game and walking the game were two very different issues,\u201d Mr. Stowe said. \u201cThis is not \u2018Alice in Wonderland.\u2019 This is Iowa. Our water\u2019s getting worse, and we\u2019re going to fight forward to protect it.\u201d That fight, however, has drawn the ire of many politicians. State Senator Randy Feenstra, a Republican, wrote in a recent blog post that the lawsuit was proof of an \u201carrogant mentality against rural Iowa.\u201d He called for rural Iowans to start an economic boycott of Des Moines. Iowa\u2019s elected agriculture secretary, Bill Northey, has also criticized the lawsuit, though with less pointed language. Mr. Northey, a Republican who farms corn and soybeans, said the effects of the lawsuit could resound far beyond the three counties named as defendants if the water utility succeeded. The state has recently invested in programs to limit nitrate runoff, he said, and more time should be allowed for those programs to work. Several farmers agreed, and many said they had seen significant progress in just the past few years. On his farm in Greene County, in central Iowa, David Ausberger planted cover crops last fall, which can help keep dirt in place between the harvest and planting seasons. In Ida and Sac Counties, Jolene Riessen said her family was reducing tilling and using other methods to limit runoff. \u201cFarmers want to do the right thing,\u201d said Ms. Riessen, a farmer and seed dealer. \u201cBut sometimes, it\u2019s learning what is the right thing, or the combination of right things, and having the finances to do it.\u201d In the meantime, as planting season begins, farmers say they are discussing the lawsuit, figuring out what it could mean for them and bracing for a contentious court battle that could last years. \u201cSome guys are mad; some guys are sad,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s concerned.\u201d",

      "author": "By REUTERS",
      "full": "CALTAGIRONE, Italy \u2014  Sixteen-year-old orphan Ishmael Bangura fled Sierra Leone in July when the Ebola virus killed eight members of his household. On his way to Italy from Libya months later, his boat capsized. He survived by clinging to a rope lowered from a rescue vessel while dozens drowned in the sea below him. Today Bangura is living in a shelter on this Sicilian hilltop town. He is part of a growing army of parentless child migrants that are washing up on Europe's shores, giving the continent's immigration crisis a tragic new face. \"I'm happy to be alive,\" said the soft-spoken Bangura on a recent morning as he sat in the shelter's front yard. The number of migrants reaching Italy by sea this year is set to top last year's record of 170,000, the International Organization for Migration said. In the past week alone 10,000 have arrived. Another 400 people drowned before making it to Italy's shores, survivors said. The number of minors traveling alone in this mass migration has soared -- underage arrivals to Italy tripled in 2014 from the previous year. This poses a particular problem for frontier countries like Italy, Spain and Greece. Italy, by law, cannot repatriate minors and is required to provide healthcare and schooling. Host countries are already under strain. In Italy, 13,000 teenagers -- mostly young men fleeing conflict, poverty or persecution -- now live in Italian immigration centers, alongside adult shelters that are bursting at the seams with some 80,000 people. The numbers are expected to rise because of the world's demographic boom. There are more 10-to 24-year-olds now than at any other time in human history, mostly living in poor countries, according to the United Nations Population Fund. \"The Mediterranean will continue to be a heavily trafficked and deadly space,\" said Maurizio Albahari, professor at Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana, and author of a soon-to-be published book called \"Crimes of Peace: Mediterranean Migrations and the World's Deadliest Border\". Facing this prospect, Italy is trying to introduce a long-term system for sheltering and integrating waves of future minors. It is tapping European Union funds to open up new shelters to be monitored by humanitarian groups that seek to help integrate the youngsters. There is resistance. Some right-wing politicians, particularly in the wealthy north of Italy, are pushing back against opening shelters in their regions. Just this week, Lombardy and Veneto, northern regions that are governed by the anti-immigration Northern League, said they would not accept any new migrants. ITALIAN SHELTERS The rise in migrants in the Mediterranean this year is largely the result of political instability in Somalia and Eritrea and the recent breakdown of order in Libya, in addition to the civil war in Syria. Financial concerns prompted Italy last year to halt a permanent search-and-rescue mission called Mare Nostrum. But coast guard and navy officials in southern Italy are still rescuing migrants daily lest they die in rough waters. Italy separates unaccompanied minors from adults in its shelters. But many of the shelters for younger migrants have lacked in specialized personnel, including interpreters or Italian teachers. They have provided little more than a bed, a meal and some cheap clothes. \"The manner in which we took in more than 14,000 minors last year makes me ashamed to be an Italian,\" Mario Morcone, the chief administrator for immigration at the Interior Ministry, told a parliamentary committee last month. Italy is trying to turn things around. In March, the state completed a 13-million-euro tender for 10 new \"first shelter\" centers, where a maximum of 50 minors are housed and given basic healthcare and language classes for up to 90 days. A tender for 10 more is underway. After staying in the \"first shelter\", the minors are due to go to a \"community\" of 12 children where they enroll in school and participate in activities including soccer. Italian courts assign guardians to the children, who are legally required to stay in the communities until they are 18. \"We are building the future of our country because we have before us a mix of peoples who now live here, who want to live here, and who want to contribute,\" said Daniele Cutugno, a psychologist who runs the shelter where Bangura lives. Domenico Manzione, undersecretary for immigration at the Interior Ministry, said new communities for some 1,000 minors should soon be set up, though he said more will be needed. \"There is no hiding the fact that we are facing a task that is far from simple because the number of arrivals is putting pressure on structures that are already strained,\" Manzione told Reuters. BUILDING A FUTURE The shelter where Bangura and 55 other African boys live is on the outskirts of Caltagirone, a city of fewer than 40,000 known for its ceramic industry. It is a refurbished, two-storey stone villa with sprawling grounds. Most of the boys there did not plan to come to Italy, and each has his own tragic reason for seeking out a future far from home at an age when teenagers in the West are occupied with video games and driving lessons. Abubacarr Dibba, 17, said he left Gambia when his father died and his family lost its land. Mustapha Kanteh, now 18, also left Gambia when his father died and a local chieftain beat him with a metal pipe and threatened to kill him. Every young man said he had been beaten and imprisoned. Bangura said he still suffers headaches from being struck by a pistol handle in Libya. Bangura said that when he reached Libya, he was kidnapped for two weeks, while his captor tried to extort a ransom from purported relatives. He was then sent to jail, before being put on a boat to Italy. Bangura said he now fasts, prays and waits. \"I didn't know anything about Italy before coming. Now I want to spend my life here. I'm here for help. Whatever the Italians do I'll be patient until they can help me.\" (Reporting by Steve Scherer, Editing by Alessandra Galloni and Angus MacSwan)",

      "full": "(Reuters) - Fast bowler Imran Khan will replace Sohail Khan, who has not recovered sufficiently from his back injury, for the two-test series in Bangladesh, the Pakistan Cricket Board said. The 31-year-old Sohail suffered back spasms and missed the three-match one-day international series, which Pakistan lost having gone down in the first two matches. Imran, 27, has played three tests for Pakistan, who have also lost batsman Sohaib Maqsood, paceman Yasir Shah and leg-spinner Yasir Shah for the Bangladesh tour through injuries. The first of the two tests start in Khulna on April 28 with the second match in Dhaka from May 6. (Writing by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)",
