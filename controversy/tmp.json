A pilot program, introduced Tuesday by the New York City public advocate\u2019s office and backed by the Clinton Global Initiative, is designed to ensure that they do not. Dozens of desk lamps fitted with air quality sensors will appear in nail salons across the city next year, providing information to health officials, customers, salon managers and the workers themselves about whether chemical levels in the air are unsafe. The program is the latest in a series of initiatives by the city and state to protect nail salon workers from dangerous work conditions and labor abuses in the wake of a two-part investigation of the industry by The New York Times. The series included an examination of the health problems, including miscarriages, cancers and respiratory issues, experienced by many manicurists who regularly bathe their hands in polishes and solvents and breathe their chemical fumes. Medical research has tied chemicals used in nail products to serious health problems. But little is known with certainty about the extent to which manicurists are actually at risk. Efforts to limit chemical exposure in salons have also been hamstrung by outdated standards, health advocates and even federal regulators say. The pilot program, which is being financed by a private equity firm, Pegasus Capital Advisors, is intended to make daily air quality information available for the first time in a range of city salons, and create an incentive for owners to improve ventilation. \u201cThey\u2019re going to use this prototype as a way to determine what nail salon they should patronize,\u201d Letitia James, the public advocate, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s really an environmental justice issue because the vast majority of the workers are immigrants, and oftentimes they\u2019re not empowered and not given the proper information.\u201d The public advocate\u2019s office said sensor chips embedded in small lamps will measure certain organic compounds in the air, a measure that health advocates say would include a range of potentially harmful ingredients. Brandon Zaharoff, an investment professional at Pegasus, said the sensors would signal the presence of the \u201ctoxic trio\u201d of chemicals associated with the most serious medical issues: toluene, dibutyl phthalate and formaldehyde. A colored indicator light on the lamp will show how poor the air quality is. The information will also be made available remotely to health officials through an online dashboard, and to salon managers through an app on their smartphones. The public advocate\u2019s office, in partnership with Pegasus and the Lighting Science Group Corporation, which makes the devices, plans to distribute 50 of the lamps to a total of about 35 salons starting in January. Salons will have to volunteer to receive one or two of the devices, but the program\u2019s backers hope it will evolve into a citywide norm as consumers gravitate to salons with the sensors. Ms. James, a Democrat, announced the pilot program on Tuesday at a panel at the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, which made the program one of its Commitments to Action. That designation, which has gone to several thousand programs over the last decade, means that the group will work to spread the program\u2019s goals and recruit additional partners. \u201cIt will really allow users to have the information to make health choices about where they choose to get their nails done, and where to push for better air quality and ventilation systems,\u201d said Mr. Zaharoff, of Pegasus, which focuses on resource sustainability and is investing about $23,000 in the pilot program. But scientists and health advocates said transparency about air quality would go only so far in an industry where regulators have been struggling to eliminate the potentially toxic chemicals outright. \u201cIf something is a toxic chemical, you don\u2019t need to measure it \u2014 you need to get rid of it,\u201d said Cora Roelofs, an assistant professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University, who conducted a study in 2011 about assessing chemical exposure in salons. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put effort in what are likely to be unreliable snapshots of the chemicals you pick. And then what are you going to compare it to?\u201d Another question hanging over the pilot program is whether its standards will be stringent enough. The devices will convert their measurements into equivalent levels of carbon dioxide, and then rely on indoor air quality standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers to decide whether chemical levels are dangerous. But the paucity of research on chemical exposure inside nail salons makes it difficult to determine what impact those standards would have. Measurements taken in nail salons have found exposure levels to be well below standards set for workplaces by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but health advocates and federal officials have said those standards are too high and needed revision. Very few studies have focused on nail workers specifically, but one published in 2011 on chemical exposure among Vietnamese workers in California salons found that chemical levels were higher than the California Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s recommended limits. The research scientist who led that study, Thu Quach, of the Cancer Prevention Institute of California, said measurements are also highly dependent on where the sensors are placed. For her study, she put sensors on workers\u2019 collars, for example, so they could capture the air near their breathing zones, and she pointed out that stationary lamps could end up farther from the nail products themselves. \u201cMy concern is that it would really underestimate the exposures,\u201d Dr. Quach said.", "sentences": [], "published": "2015-09-30"}, {"byline": "By MAGGIE HABERMAN and AMY CHOZICK", "score": 192.49048536443459, "lead": "Ms. Shalala, 74, fell ill after leaving the closing events around the Clinton Global Initiative in New York.", "title": "Donna Shalala, President of Clinton Foundation, Has Stroke", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/us/donna-shalala-president-of-clinton-foundation-has-stroke.html", "abstract": "Ms. Shalala, 74, fell ill after leaving the closing events around the Clinton Global Initiative in New York.", "xlarge": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2015/09/30/us/01Shalala-web/01Shalala-web-articleLarge.jpg", "source": "The New York Times", "full": "Donna Shalala, the former president of the University of Miami who was brought in to lead the Clinton Foundation this year, had a stroke shortly after the closing ceremonies of the organization\u2019s major fall event early Tuesday evening, officials said. Ms. Shalala, 74, fell ill after departing the closing events around the Clinton Global Initiative, which was held at the Sheraton New York hotel on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, according to a statement from foundation officials. An email from former President Bill Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea, who is the vice chairwoman of the foundation and a major force in running the organization, was sent to the staff late in evening. \u201cAs some of you may have heard, Donna suffered a stroke this evening after CGI,\u201d the email read. \u201cFortunately, she was with colleagues at the time and taken to the hospital for treatment. Initial reports are very encouraging.\u201d They added, \u201cWe will continue to share updates as we know more. Please join Hillary, Chelsea and me in keeping Donna in your thoughts and prayers.\u201d Mr. Clinton visited Ms. Shalala Tuesday evening, according to a person briefed on their discussion, and they had what the person called \u201ca good conversation\u201d after surgery. She was said to be alert and making jokes with him, which he found relieving. The president of the University of Miami for more than a decade and the school\u2019s first female leader, Ms. Shalala was hired last March as the new head of the Clinton Foundation. Her appointment came after the Clinton Foundation had experienced some tumultuous times. In 2013, Eric Braverman, a friend and former colleague of hers at McKinsey & Co. was chosen to take over as chief executive, replacing Bruce R. Lindsey, a longtime confidant to Mr. Clinton in Little Rock, Ark. But Mr. Braverman\u2019s consultant-driven style clashed with the Clinton culture and he departed after just 18 months on the job. Chelsea Clinton had helped persuade Ms. Shalala to leave her position in Miami and move to New York to run the Clinton Foundation and help rein in the at times feuding personalities who run its disparate entities. Her appointment came as Mrs. Clinton tapped another trusted Clinton administration aide, John D. Podesta, to be chairman of her campaign. Ms. Shalala, a close friend to both Clintons, served as secretary of health and human services in the Clinton administration and unlike other cabinet members, was known for her ability to confront and be direct with the former president. She is viewed in Clinton inner circles as a sober and highly competent figure, who has the full confidence of both Bill and Hillary Clinton. Ms. Shalala was present throughout the Clinton Global Initiative this past week, receiving praise from Mr. Clinton and applause from the crowd as the event kicked off on Sunday. The gathering was the first opportunity for Ms. Shalala to be seen at the helm of the global foundation, which has been Mr. Clinton\u2019s main focus in his post-presidency. The charity has come under intense scrutiny since Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign began.", "sentences": [{"tweets": [{"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "buffaloon", "tweet": "Clinton comes out against TPP  http://t.co/zXubFya1Ck", "clean_tweet": "Clinton comes out against TPP", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2172998794/images_normal.jpg", "followers": 6082, "identifier": 652246914222694400, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "JenEnnenbach", "tweet": "Hillary Rodham Clinton #ScareMeIn3Words", "clean_tweet": "Hillary Rodham Clinton #ScareMeIn3Words", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/601946423177777153/707xX2xo_normal.jpg", "followers": 2441, "identifier": 652246938285408256, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 3.0, "author": "ZEROFiltered", "tweet": "Trump And Clinton Still On Top http://t.co/4H4FQIOOv4 @CNNPolitics @AnnCoulter @nytpolitics @foxnewspolitics @RollingStone @oreillyfactor", "clean_tweet": "Trump And Clinton Still On Top", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/500768924393156608/QllR9nl0_normal.jpeg", "followers": 272, "identifier": 652247089175355392, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "pacowacodog", "tweet": "Vote for Chelsea Clinton Mother of the Year", "clean_tweet": "Vote for Chelsea Clinton Mother of the Year", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/437663427817783297/iUBZBWUx_normal.png", "followers": 332, "identifier": 652247026176921600, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.5, "author": "Myralla_ESO", "tweet": "RT @EvilEsq: Who would you rather have as First Lady?\n\nRT for Melania Trump\n\nFAV for Bill Clinton http://t.co/ZlBi5WCpSS", "clean_tweet": "RT Who would you rather have as First Lady?

Ryan of Clinton County Court told the former employee, Joyce E. Mitchell, during her sentencing hearing. \u201cAt any time, you could have stopped the escape from happening.\u201d Under the terms of her plea agreement, Ms. Mitchell could spend up to seven years in prison. Ms. Mitchell, wearing a black-and-white prison uniform, wept in court and struggled to read a statement apologizing for her role in helping Richard W. Matt and David Sweat escape from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y. \u201cI am 51 years old, and this is by far the worst mistake I have made in my life,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cI live with regret every day and will for the rest of my life.\u201d Ms. Mitchell said she loved her husband and family and asked for mercy. \u201cI am not a bad person,\u201d she said. \u201cI clearly made a horrible mistake.\u201d Judge Ryan said he had received many letters from the public asking him to reject the deal and sentence Ms. Mitchell to more time. \u201cLetter writers seem to believe that if additional charges were brought, an additional sentence could be eventually imposed if there were a conviction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem with this thought is that it confuses the separate roles of the court and the prosecutor.\u201d He said he had no authority to alter the deal but made it clear that he did not believe Ms. Mitchell\u2019s argument that she was acting out of fear for her family. Judge Ryan said that the prison escape had cost the state millions and had noneconomic costs that were \u201cincalculable.\u201d \u201cA large portion of the local population was terrorized,\u201d he said. \u201cMany residents did not sleep for many nights.\u201d He said that scores of police officers engaged in the hunt for the men, \u201cnever knowing if the next step they took in deeply wooded areas would be their last.\u201d In July, Ms. Mitchell pleaded guilty to playing a central role in helping Mr. Matt and Mr. Sweat escape. After three weeks on the run, Mr. Matt was shot and killed by a federal agent in the woods of Malone, N.Y., about 35 miles west of the prison. Mr. Sweat was shot and apprehended two days later by a State Police sergeant who spotted him running down a rural road just south of the Canadian border. Mr. Sweat is now at the Five Points Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Romulus, N.Y. Ms. Mitchell was a supervisor in the prison tailor shop, where both inmates worked. At her plea hearing in July, she acknowledged her role, and in her statements, she exposed a culture of improper relations between prison workers and inmates there. Ms. Mitchell acknowledged performing sexual favors for one of the men, and she outlined how she gave them tools that aided in their escape, including hacksaw blades and a screwdriver bit. The Clinton County district attorney, Andrew J. Wylie, said on Monday that under the terms of the deal, Ms. Mitchell would be given a sentence of 28 months to seven years and required to pay a $6,000 fine. She waived her right to a trial, he said, and has fully cooperated with the state. Stephen Johnston, Ms. Mitchell\u2019s lawyer, said his client had sat for more than 40 hours of interviews with the police and 10 hours with state investigators. \u201cShe is very remorseful for what she did,\u201d he said. \u201cShe feels horrible for what she did.\u201d Mr. Johnston said that while there was no disputing Ms. Mitchell\u2019s role in the breakout, he believed that the men must have had help from others and that fact should not be lost because of Ms. Mitchell\u2019s admission. \u201cI just do not understand how these men could have escaped without power tools,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe there was some other assistance, some way somehow, provided to these men.\u201d A corrections officer, Gene Palmer, has been charged with promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence and official misconduct, all in connection with the escape. He has pleaded not guilty. After pleading guilty this summer, Ms. Mitchell gave an interview to the \u201cToday\u201d show on NBC, telling Matt Lauer that the convicts exploited her emotional instability and that she ultimately helped the men escape because she feared for the safety of her family. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like my husband loved me anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I guess it was just me. I was going through depression. And I guess they saw my weakness and that\u2019s how it all started.\u201d She said that the sexual contact with one of the prisoners was not consensual. \u201cI\u2019m not the monster that everybody thinks I am,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really not. I\u2019m just somebody that got caught up in something that she couldn\u2019t get out of.\u201d", "sentences": [], "published": "2015-09-29"}, {}, {"byline": "By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ and MICHAEL WINERIP", "score": 268.5294881904436, "lead": "Inmates at Clinton Correctional Facility, the prison from which two men escaped in June, have identified the guard as Chad Stickney, who has been accused of choking an inmate.

But one guard, the inmates said, stood out. He had a large tattoo of the American flag down his left arm and was known around the prison as Captain America. No officer has been publicly implicated in any wrongdoing since an investigation by The New York Times nearly two months ago found what appeared to be a campaign of retribution against dozens of Clinton inmates after the escape at the prison. Now, through interviews with inmates, The Times has identified Captain America as Chad Stickney, a gang intelligence officer and onetime steward in the state corrections officers\u2019 union. The inmates\u2019 willingness to come forward and be named speaks to their growing frustration with the pace of the investigation into their allegations. Amid worsening violence at the prison, some inmates said they had been subjected to further harassment after speaking out. In the frantic days after the prison break, inmates said in letters and interviews with The Times that guards handcuffed them, took them for questioning into areas of the prison with no cameras, punched them and slammed them against the wall. One inmate described having a plastic bag pulled over his head and being threatened with \u201cwaterboarding.\u201d Victor Aponte, 60, who is serving a life sentence for kidnapping and rape, said it was the officer known as Captain America who tied a plastic bag around his neck like a noose during an interrogation and pulled it so tightly that Mr. Aponte passed out. Later, Mr. Aponte said, he had asked around at the prison and had learned that the guard was Officer Stickney. Three other prisoners who were at Clinton at the time of the escape, Rashad Scott, Eddie Matos and Luis Zenon, also told The Times that Officer Stickney was Captain America. Mr. Zenon, along with another inmate, Paul Davila, also named a second prison employee, Kevin Norcross, as being present during some beatings. Mr. Davila said that Mr. Norcross had identified himself as a member of the internal affairs unit with the State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. While Mr. Norcross did not take part in the beatings, the inmates said, he witnessed them. Inmate accounts are frequently viewed skeptically by investigators. The Times interviewed six inmates at two different prisons for this article, and while they gave consistent accounts, their version of events could not be independently verified. Officer Stickney did not respond to repeated requests for comment, nor did Mr. Norcross. Neither Officer Stickney nor any other officer accused of taking part in beatings after the escape has been criminally charged. James Miller, the spokesman for the corrections officers\u2019 union, said that no officer had been disciplined in connection with the allegations and that Officer Stickney has had a clean disciplinary record in his 18 years as a corrections officer. Michael Powers, the president of the corrections officers\u2019 union, said in a statement that had there been cases of brutality, officers from state, federal and local law enforcement agencies working inside the prison after the escape would have been aware of it. \u201cIt is troubling and irresponsible to report allegations against officers as fact,\u201d Mr. Powers said. \u201cMost New Yorkers would question the validity of accusations coming from convicted violent felons, who have long criminal histories and nothing to lose by making such claims.\u201d Officer Stickney, who was chief steward for the corrections officers union at the Ogdensburg Correctional Facility before moving to the Clinton prison in 2012, has been sued three times for alleged assault and harassment. One of the lawsuits was terminated after the inmate who filed it died. Two others are still active, including a suit filed in September by Terry Daum, an inmate who claimed that Officer Stickney punched him several times in the head and grabbed his genitals during a search. The lawsuit also said \u201cStickney utilized his hand to aggressively rub plaintiff\u2019s rectum like a credit card swipe and then attempted to jam his fingertips into plaintiff\u2019s rectum.\u201d Four months after two convicted murderers, Richard W. Matt and David Sweat, escaped through the tunnels under the prison in Dannemora, N.Y., Clinton remains a tense place. There have been at least three major brawls among inmates, with officers using tear gas and, in one case, live ammunition to bring the prison under control, according to the corrections department. The state\u2019s inspector general is expected in the coming months to release a report detailing security lapses that led to the escape. And the corrections agency has promised to investigate inmates\u2019 claims of abuse. Asked at a recent news conference whether there was a problem with brutality by guards in the state prison system, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that while there might be a few isolated incidents, officers were doing a \u201cgood job.\u201d \u201cState prisons are filled with very dangerous people,\u201d Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said. \u201cThey are policed by a relatively small number of correction officials, who are unarmed, I might add. It is a very, very difficult job. They have to make sure they get a certain amount of respect in the job, otherwise they get hurt.\u201d The Correctional Association of New York, an inmate advocacy group with a legislative mandate to monitor the prisons, recently interviewed 30 Clinton inmates who described continuing abuse. Of those, two said they had been assaulted by Officer Stickney before the escape; one of the two claimed a plastic bag had been placed over his head during an interrogation. After complaining about the beatings to investigators, lawyers and reporters, the inmates appear to have suffered further consequences. Mr. Aponte, who described being choked by Officer Stickney, said in a prison interview in September that after the publication of the article in The Times, he was visited by a corrections department investigator who sought more information. Mr. Aponte said he told the investigator who Captain America was. The status of that investigation is unclear. But Mr. Aponte said that after speaking with The Times, he was locked in his cell for 23 hours a day and not told why. Patrick Alexander, another inmate who spoke with The Times, was confined to his cell for a disciplinary infraction he believes was fabricated. After speaking with investigators, Mr. Aponte wrote a letter to the authorities requesting a transfer to another prison because he feared for his safety. He received no response for more than a month. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of retaliation,\u201d he said in an interview in September. \u201cI know how they operate.\u201d After The Times inquired about Mr. Aponte\u2019s request, corrections officials transferred him this week. The prison break in early June set off a manhunt. Mr. Matt was killed by a federal agent three weeks later; two days after that, Mr. Sweat was captured. The escape highlighted serious security failings at Clinton. Investigators say officers would routinely sleep during overnight shifts, allowing Mr. Matt and Mr. Sweat to spend hours each night searching the prison\u2019s underground tunnels for a way out. Joyce E. Mitchell, a former civilian employee at Clinton, was sentenced this week to a minimum of two years and four months in prison after pleading guilty to providing Mr. Matt and Mr. Sweat with hacksaws and other tools. A guard at the prison has also been criminally charged. Nine officers were suspended after the escape, and the prison\u2019s leadership team, including the superintendent, was removed. No inmates have been charged in the breakout. In a memorandum dated Sept. 16, the corrections department warned officers not to punish inmates who spoke to the news media. \u201cAn inmate who has been interviewed by representatives of the news media shall not be subject to departmental discipline or any other adverse action,\u201d the memo said. Mr. Alexander said that was exactly what happened to him after he told The Times that officers had beaten him and threatened to use waterboarding during an interrogation shortly after the escape. At Shawangunk Correctional Facility, where he was transferred, Mr. Alexander said he had been verbally harassed by officers who referred to him as the \u201cClinton inmate\u201d and called him a snitch. He has also been subjected to frequent frisking by guards, he said, and kept his boots untied so that they could be removed quickly during searches. In a September interview, Mr. Alexander said that he had not been compensated for personal possessions lost during his transfer from Clinton, including photo albums, journals, a hot plate, a lamp, beard trimmers and a 13-inch color television. On Aug. 25, Mr. Alexander said that within a few hours of signing a consent form to be interviewed by CNN, he had been singled out by guards to provide a urine sample. Though he had never had a drug infraction during his 11 years in prison, or any other serious disciplinary issue, according to his records, an officer said he was suspected of using marijuana. A week later, according to prison records, the test came back positive for THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana. The corrections department uses a drug test called EMIT that some medical professionals say can yield a false positive for THC. The results from the test given to Mr. Alexander should have been verified using a second method, said Dr. Louis Baxter, director of the American Board of Addiction Medicine. The Times provided Dr. Baxter with a copy of Mr. Alexander\u2019s urinalysis records. \u201cThis test I reviewed could have been positive because of the use of ibuprofen,\u201d he wrote in an email. The corrections department said in a statement that the drug-testing method had been challenged in court and found reliable. Mr. Alexander, the statement said, was one of four inmates chosen to be tested as part of an investigation into drug use at Shawangunk. At a prison hearing, Mr. Alexander said he had not used marijuana and accused officers of falsifying the test results to punish him for speaking to the media. The hearing officer found him guilty, confined him to his cell for 30 days and stripped him of privileges, including using the phone and the commissary, for 90 days. The officer also wanted the television removed from his cell, but Mr. Alexander said that would not be necessary because the corrections department had already lost it.", "sentences": [{"tweets": [{"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "jesseahamilton", "tweet": "Bloomberg takes a closer look at what Clinton would like to do with Wall Street: http://t.co/PXyostTqmw via @bpolitics", "clean_tweet": "Bloomberg takes a closer look at what Clinton would like to do with Wall Street: via", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/266088685/TwitterCapitol_normal.jpg", "followers": 960, "identifier": 652247272483356672, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.5, "author": "Myralla_ESO", "tweet": "RT @EvilEsq: Who would you rather have as First Lady?\n\nRT for Melania Trump\n\nFAV for Bill Clinton http://t.co/ZlBi5WCpSS", "clean_tweet": "RT Who would you rather have as First Lady?

Mrs. Clinton will attend what is being billed as a \u201cgrass-roots\u201d rally Friday afternoon at Broward College in Davie, a town of 90,000 people about 25 miles north of Miami. The college is accustomed to dignitary visits: the school hosted last year\u2019s debate for governor and has provided security for Michelle Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, and even the Dalai Lama. But this time, when crowd expectations began to swell, the Davie Police Department balked at spending several extra thousand dollars on police overtime, according to several people familiar with the preparations.  The town\u2019s sudden turnabout raised eyebrows about whether the decision was political in nature. Broward County is a Democratic stronghold where President Obama won 67 percent of the vote in 2012. But Davie is a rural enclave, with an old western atmosphere that stands out from the rest of the county. A rally in support of the Confederate flag took place this summer nearby. An assistant police chief who attended an interagency meeting to prepare for the visit announced the news that the city would not provide security. The Secret Service officials who were at the meeting did not take it well, and promised to name names about the episode if ever called before Congress, according to one of the people at the meeting, who was not authorized to discuss the private session. The Secret Service turned to the local sheriff\u2019s office, Broward College\u2019s security team and nearby Florida Atlantic University for extra assistance.  \u201cWhen you task a small municipality like Davie, it\u2019s tough on them. They have a budget and it\u2019s hard to stay within budget when something like that happens,\u201d said William Cachinero, assistant special agent in charge of the Miami field office. \u201cWe were recently there with the vice president. It probably ate up their budget for the month.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time an agency has pushed back on the added costs. In 2001, officials in Kennebunkport, Me., said they would not offer any more help for George W. Bush\u2019s visits to his family\u2019s summer estate unless the federal government reimbursed the costs. In 2008, the mayor of a Kentucky town was miffed that the Clinton campaign stiffed the city on a $142 bill. The local paper found that the campaign regularly reimbursed cities for security costs. The Clinton campaign referred questions to the Secret Service, which in turn said that it relies on local support, but doesn\u2019t pay for it. \u201cWhile we understand this support often results in costs to the communities that host protective visits, the Secret Service is not funded to reimburse communities for these costs and the Secret Service does not pay for police overtime associated with protective visits,\u201d said Robert Hoback, an agency spokesman. The Davie Police Department declined to say how much that tab would have been. \u201cWe are working with the Secret Service to provide a safe environment to the people going,\u201d said Capt. Dale Engle. \u201cThere is a cost associated with providing that security.\u201d", "sentences": [], "published": "2015-10-01"}, {"byline": "By MAGGIE HABERMAN", "score": 184.65906599475878, "lead": "The proposal most likely to generate controversy is using executive action to close the so-called gun show loophole if efforts to pass new measures in Congress do not succeed.", "title": "To Curb Gun Violence, Hillary Clinton Has a Plan for Possible Executive Action", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/us/to-curb-gun-violence-hillary-clinton-has-a-plan-for-possible-executive-action.html", "abstract": "Hillary Rodham Clinton will use New Hampshire campaign events to outline her plan for decreasing gun violence; proposals, likely to attract opposition from Congress and National Rifle Assn, include using executive action to close background check loopholes in selling weapons at gun shows and to felons; has also discussed leading 'national movement' intended to counter NRA", "xlarge": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2015/10/05/us/05clinton/05clinton-articleLarge.jpg", "source": "The New York Times", "full": "On the heels of the nation\u2019s latest mass shooting, Hillary Rodham Clinton will issue proposals on Monday to curb gun violence, including holding out the potential of using executive actions. Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, will announce the new proposals in separate town-hall-style events in New Hampshire, a state with a Democratic senator who has voted for some gun-control measures but where there is a thriving gun and hunting culture. The proposals will come just days after Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to lead a \u201cnational movement\u201d to counter the National Rifle Association, after another mass shooting, this time at a college in Oregon, left nine people dead. Mrs. Clinton has made gun control a constant in her campaign speeches since the Charleston, S.C., shootings in which nine black congregants were killed. The proposal most likely to generate controversy is using executive action to close the so-called gun show loophole, if efforts to pass new measures in Congress do not succeed, according to a campaign aide to Mrs. Clinton, who asked for anonymity to lay out the plans before the candidate does. Most of the ideas would face a steep battle with the Republican-led Congress, and efforts to pass new gun restrictions in the wake of the murders of 20 schoolchildren and six adults in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012 failed in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Since then, there have been a number of mass shootings, including the most recent, at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., last week. But her proposals are in sharp contrast to the Republican presidential hopefuls, and she is making them as her main rival in the primary polls, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has gained ground against her, but has also come under scrutiny among Democrats for some gun control policies he has opposed in the past. A central issue in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals are the background checks on prospective gun buyers, which are required for retailers at stores. But under federal law, they are not required at gun shows or over the Internet with private sellers. Under Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan, she would use administrative powers to make anyone selling a substantial number of guns declared \u201cin the business\u201d of firearms dealing, and subject to the same rules as retailers, if Congress does not act, according to the campaign aide. It was not immediately clear what the bar for being declared \u201cin the business\u201d would be. And use of executive action in connection with guns is certain to face criticism from staunch supporters of the Second Amendment. It is also likely to be applauded by Democrats who have grown weary of gridlock in Congress. Earlier in the evening, another Democratic candidate, Martin O\u2019Malley, urged Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders to embrace policies he supports, including a reinstatement of the lapsed federal assault weapons ban. That does not appear to be among those she will suggest. Mrs. Clinton will suggest urging Congress to end another loophole, by which people with felony records who should be barred from obtaining a gun can get one if their background check is not completed within three days. That loophole was how Dylann Roof, the accused killer in Charleston, obtained his weapon despite a felony conviction for a drug arrest. Since the Charleston shooting, Mrs. Clinton has frequently talked about gun control, but her comments have grown stronger. On Friday, a day after the shootings in Oregon, Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to lead a \u201cnational movement\u201d that would counter the National Rifle Association. \u201cHere\u2019s what the other side counts on,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cThey count on really having an intense, dedicated group that scare politicians and say, \u2018We will vote against you.\u2019\u00a0\u201d", "sentences":

The scene began with the comedian Kate McKinnon in character with Mrs. Clinton nursing a \u201cscalding hot vodka\u201d at a dive bar as she overhears people talking about voting for Donald J. Trump.  \u201cOh, Huma, why won\u2019t the people just let me lead?\u201d she said to a glamorous black-haired assistant meant to be Mrs. Clinton\u2019s real-life aide, Huma Abedin.

He then caught a glimpse of the real and fake Hillary. \u201cMy God, they\u2019re multiplying,\u201d he said.
