But party elders worry that escalating anti-immigrant rhetoric could cost Republicans the White House in 2016. The aggressive words, in particular from front-runners Donald Trump and Ben Carson, have exacerbated a widening rift between the GOP's pragmatic and ideological wings as the party tries to avoid losing a third consecutive presidential election. His relationship with the nation's Hispanic community already strained, Trump vowed on Wednesday to deport any Syrian refugee taken in by the U.S. Most likely would be Muslim, and Trump warned they could be Islamic State militants in disguise. \"If I win, they're going back,\" the billionaire businessman said. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, launched a petition on Thursday challenging the nation's largest Muslim advocacy group's tax-exempt status, escalating his ongoing rift with the U.S. Muslim community. The Council on American-Islamic Relations last month called for Carson to quit the presidential race after he said a Muslim should not serve as president. He has since clarified his position, stating he wouldn't support a radical Muslim who did not support the Constitution. And in a Thursday radio interview, Carson said the same standard should apply to a Supreme Court justice. He said Islam is \"a lifestyle\" that he'd \"need to know about\" before making an appointment to the nation's highest court. \"If I were the one nominating such a person, I would spend a good deal of time looking at their background and seeing if it is consistent with the kinds of standards that we expect from such a position,\" Carson told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, adding that a nominee would have to publicly reject Islamic law. There are currently no Supreme Court vacancies and no presidential candidates adhere to Muslim law, although some conservatives have repeatedly tried to link President Barack Obama to Islam. He is a Christian. Carson's fortunes have surged since he first said he wouldn't support a Muslim president. He raised roughly $700,000 and added more than 100,000 Facebook friends in the 36 hours after making the comment, said campaign manager Barry Bennett. The focus on Islam comes as Republicans work to repair a strained relationship with the nation's surging Hispanic population, a critical voting bloc in presidential elections. The U.S. Muslim population is a fraction of the size of the Hispanic community, yet the party's overall tone could complicate broader outreach efforts. Political observers in both parties agree, among them, the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney. More than anything, he said of his lessons from his failed campaign, is that Republicans must do a better job at connecting with minority voters. \"I think it's been unfortunate that some of the rhetoric has so clouded the picture that some people think we're anti-immigrant. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" Romney said, prompting audible laughs of disbelief from the crowd gathered at a Washington conference on Wednesday. \"Hey guys. My party is pro-legal immigration. Massively,\" Romney pleaded and later added, \"The rhetoric has been terribly unfortunate in many respects.\" Foreign policy analyst Rula Jebreal cited a sharp shift in the GOP's present-day tone compared to 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain and former President George W. Bush, who visited a mosque shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to demonstrate religious tolerance. \"Islamophobia is now an industry,\" Jebreal said. \"In the long run it will hurt the Republican Party and it will hurt the country in general.\" Yet there is some evidence that anti-Muslim rhetoric resonates with voters in both parties. A June Gallup poll found that 54 percent of Republicans would not vote for a well-qualified Muslim nominee from their own party; 39 percent of independents and 27 percent of Democrats said the same. The U.S. Muslim population is growing, according to a May survey by the Pew Research Center, which found the group remains extremely small, representing just under 1 percent of the U.S. population. Meanwhile, some Republican presidential candidates have adopted a softer tone. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whom conservatives have been slow to embrace, said Trump should show \"some sensitivity\" to the Syrian refugee crisis. \"We have an obligation to make sure that people coming here are legitimate, but send them all back? To a hellhole?\" Bush said Wednesday. Democrats are trying to capitalize, with 2016 front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton casting Trump as the poster boy for the Republican Party and someone who has been \"trafficking in prejudice and paranoia.\" She criticized his comments about Syrian refugees following a campaign stop in Massachusetts. \"I don't know what country he thinks he's living in,\" Clinton said Thursday in an interview with WHDH-TV in Boston. \"We have a long and proud tradition of accepting refugees from conflict.\" Meanwhile, Romney downplayed Trump's chances in 2016. \"I will support the Republican nominee. I don't think that's going to be Donald Trump,\" Romney charged. Trump fired back Thursday, writing on Twitter that Romney let his party down in 2012. \"Should've won,\" Trump tweeted. \"He choked!\" ___ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Ken Thomas contributed to this report.", "sentences": [{"tweets": [{"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 4.0, "author": "bdskro77", "tweet": "@JulieBanderas Mitt Romney will make an excellent presidential President", "clean_tweet": "Mitt Romney will make an excellent presidential President", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/628774589414309888/hYga62tM_normal.jpg", "followers": 3, "identifier": 650457464408702976, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "RhoaChri", "tweet": "Mitt Romney weighs in on 2016, says Trump \u2018will not be the nominee\u2019 http://t.co/5UvPJDtb6C", "clean_tweet": "Mitt Romney weighs in on 2016, says Trump \u2018will not be the nominee\u2019", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/650345313278922752/qkkhQyWv_normal.jpg", "followers": 5573, "identifier": 650454531868725249, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "monteiro", "tweet": "Dukakis\u2019 tank, Romney\u2019s binders, Dean\u2019s scream, and now Trump\u2019s holster. https://t.co/5NPnVsThoH", "clean_tweet": "Dukakis\u2019 tank, Romney\u2019s binders, Dean\u2019s scream, and now Trump\u2019s holster.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/552632215503245312/jtlGzC07_normal.jpeg", "followers": 53687, "identifier": 650449067827265536, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.7333333333333334, "author": "bannerite", "tweet": "RT @575haiku: @bannerite @wessmith123 But Romney never said the 47% were \"Doggie Bags\"!

The Wisconsin governor relishes talking about politics the way other men talk about golf, and he had plenty to say on the subject of why Mitt Romney lost to President Obama in 2012. \u201cHe didn\u2019t make the case \u2014 his message should\u2019ve been based on his track record as governor, on him being a turnaround agent,\u201d Walker told me. \u201cInstead, they took the best things about Mitt Romney and hid them.\u201d In particular, Walker argued, Romney had failed to make the positive case for his presidency. \u201cThey made the huge mistake of thinking that the 1980 Reagan campaign was based on the premise of that great question, \u2018Are you better off than you were four years ago?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they failed to realize is that that wasn\u2019t his argument \u2014 it was his closing argument. The larger argument was smaller government, lower taxes, more freedom. And that way, people could see not only that life was miserable under Jimmy Carter but that life would be better under Ronald Reagan. Often as Republicans we tend to do this \u2014 we get what\u2019s wrong about Barack Obama. And Americans know it, too; you didn\u2019t need to beat it in. You needed to show how you\u2019d be different.\u201d In retrospect, Walker\u2019s criticism of Romney is revealing: It suggests the extent to which he was concerned with the message of campaigning at the expense of building an operation. It\u2019s true that on the most basic level, Walker, for all his manifestly evident ambition, did little to prepare himself for the scrutiny that comes with a national campaign. He demurred on questions ranging from the Islamic State to evolution. He characterized the idea of building a wall on the Canadian border as \u201clegitimate.\u201d And when asked whether he agreed with Trump\u2019s proposal to repeal birthright citizenship for those born in the United States to immigrants here illegally, Walker said that he did \u2014 then, later, that he had no position on the subject and finally that in fact he didn\u2019t agree with Trump on the matter. These weren\u2019t gaffes, per se; they were indicators that the upwardly mobile Walker simply hadn\u2019t slowed down long enough to think through the issues of the day. But many of the campaigning failures that could be laid at Walker\u2019s feet were also committed by the last governor to inhabit the White House, George W. Bush. In the 2000 election, Bush didn\u2019t know the names of several foreign leaders, referred to the Greeks as \u201cGrecians\u201d and the Kosovars as \u201cKosovarians\u201d and conducted a listless front-runner campaign that caused him to be poleaxed by John McCain in the New Hampshire primary. But his resilience on the campaign trail, versus Walker\u2019s collapse, shows that the difference between mounting a presidential effort and sustaining one still resides in the candidate\u2019s organization. Bush\u2019s chief strategist, Karl Rove, had been quietly arranging meetings between the Texas governor and foreign-policy experts fully two years before the general election. By the time Bush announced his exploratory committee in March 1999, the eventual Bush White House chief of staff Josh Bolten had already begun to assemble what would be a vast policy shop of issue advisers who met with the candidate regularly. It\u2019s arguably true that strategists like Rove, James Carville and David Plouffe accrue too much credit for a campaign\u2019s success. But there\u2019s something to be said for enlisting a trusted adviser who will assemble a plan for victory even before the decision to wage a campaign is made. The chief rap on Walker among his fellow Wisconsin Republicans was that his kitchen cabinet was not exactly a dream team, particularly when it came to national politics. Walker, they argued, lacked a Karl Rove mostly because he believed he was his own Rove. In apparently relying on his own political wisdom for longer than he should have, Walker proved the axiom sometimes attributed to the greatest of all Republicans, Abraham Lincoln: \u201cHe who represents himself has a fool for a client.\u201d Having said that, Walker is not yet 48 and presumably has other campaigns ahead of him. He leaves the race with a fairly clean record; there was no \u201coops\u201d moment in the manner of Perry, and he hadn\u2019t yet piled up significant campaign debt. And, in urging the Republican field to unify in their opposition to his tormentor Trump, Walker\u2019s exit may create pressure for others \u2014 such as Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, Jim Gilmore and Rand Paul \u2014 to do the same. If so, then Scott Walker will have become, in defeat, a party figure not unlike the 2012 nominee he criticized last year: a sadder but wiser politician, counseling from the sidelines based on bitter experience.", "sentences": [{"tweets": [{"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.5, "author": "alexhartzler", "tweet": "@R_Thaler Romney ;)", "clean_tweet": "Romney ;)", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1516406896/IMG_5951_crop6_normal.jpg", "followers": 472, "identifier": 650452863609634816, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "xocaducajan", "tweet": "Obama Romney #VoteObama", "clean_tweet": "Obama Romney #VoteObama", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/540798730408964096/XwK6b0VZ_normal.jpeg", "followers": 1025, "identifier": 650444252128899072, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": true, "sentiment": 1.0, "author": "inartic", "tweet": "They felt sorry for Romney and McCain when they lost. https://t.co/iYS4muR5oR", "clean_tweet": "They felt sorry for Romney and McCain when they lost.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/649294551601975297/YQgP4at8_normal.jpg", "followers": 3494, "identifier": 650457647355817984, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 3.8, "author": "marquitachisho2", "tweet": "RT @crystal_clanton: Mitt Romney would have been an incredible President.  https://t.co/B2GU4o5pkJ", "clean_tweet": "RT Mitt Romney would have been an incredible President.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/648178176871538688/6dO6Vkra_normal.jpg", "followers": 304, "identifier": 650454625464786944, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 4.0, "author": "bdskro77", "tweet": "@JulieBanderas Mitt Romney will make an excellent presidential President", "clean_tweet": "Mitt Romney will make an excellent presidential President", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/628774589414309888/hYga62tM_normal.jpg", "followers": 3, "identifier": 650457464408702976, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "AntosBobbicca", "tweet": "Mitt Romney X Benedict Cumberbatch http://t.co/GSvieY57QV", "clean_tweet": "Mitt Romney X Benedict Cumberbatch", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/632639236383068164/pvlXpGBN_normal.jpg", "followers": 9, "identifier": 650448842538795008, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": true, "sentiment": 1.0, "author": "_JoelSantamaria", "tweet": "RT @WorIdStarComedy: When Mitt Romney's family spells Romney wrong. http://t.co/IOLrjuayiy", "clean_tweet": "RT When Mitt Romney's family spells Romney wrong.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/623270558495571970/sRcbFEdF_normal.jpg", "followers": 243, "identifier": 650450628062367744, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.4, "author": "hiorheymukeaf", "tweet": "RT @PresidentiaIRap: Will the real Mitt Romney please stand up  http://t.co/Evv38XO4cb", "clean_tweet": "RT Will the real Mitt Romney please stand up", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/645470566355443712/MwORTk81_normal.jpg", "followers": 1038, "identifier": 650444634053701632, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.7, "author": "palamity", "tweet": "@deray like Romney's \"binders full of women\"", "clean_tweet": "like Romney's \"binders full of women\"", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/598957654019543041/PNUsQISg_normal.jpg", "followers": 229, "identifier": 650443390874714112, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "RhoaChri", "tweet": "Mitt Romney weighs in on 2016, says Trump \u2018will not be the nominee\u2019 http://t.co/5UvPJDtb6C", "clean_tweet": "Mitt Romney weighs in on 2016, says Trump \u2018will not be the nominee\u2019", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/650345313278922752/qkkhQyWv_normal.jpg", "followers": 5573, "identifier": 650454531868725249, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "cherryone", "tweet": "FLASHBACK: Obama Mocks Romney for His Concerns About Putin, Russia http://t.co/ZUE2xiFPSI", "clean_tweet": "FLASHBACK: Obama Mocks Romney for His Concerns About Putin, Russia", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/562739139796160512/Zw_Ya3mv_normal.jpeg", "followers": 1230, "identifier": 650454142553468928, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "BigLeagueTom", "tweet": "RT @elliosch: NYT editorial board hammered Romney in 2012 for warning about Russia. http://t.co/gTM5t6g47i http://t.co/1IIGzdD0R1", "clean_tweet": "RT NYT editorial board hammered Romney in 2012 for warning about Russia.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/638391813452206080/6ZuMxMy-_normal.jpg", "followers": 290, "identifier": 650445106462498816, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "danny6831", "tweet": "@shootingfurfun just think how different our country would be if Romney was President!

Yet Donald Trump's tax plan adds to the number of major GOP presidential candidates who propose to cut all taxes \u2014 but especially those for the wealthy \u2014 as deeply, or deeper, than Romney proposed. The lesson Republicans seem to have drawn is to simply stop worrying about balancing the budget. The plans would blow open deficits over the next decade that economists estimate ranging from $3.6 trillion to $12 trillion. Oren Cass, who was Romney's domestic policy adviser, noted the former Massachusetts governor had pledged to make his tax cuts deficit-neutral by cutting tax loopholes, though he never fully detailed how his plan would do so. Yet he was still savaged by Democrats who accused him of planning to stiff middle-class ratepayers for the benefit of the rich. \"You look at what Gov. Romney did and you say, 'There's nothing to be gained from being responsible that way,' \" Cass said. \"You may as well do the plan that your base is going to love.\" Trump initially hinted he might buck conservative economic orthodoxy and raise taxes on the wealthy. But he ended up releasing the most aggressive tax cut of all candidates to date. The Tax Foundation, which favors lower taxes, estimated that his plan would increase the deficit by $12 trillion.  The foundation found more than one-fifth of the plan's benefit would accrue to the top 1 percent of income earners. Trump's plan pointed to the enduring power of traditional conservative thinking \u2014 that lower taxes are the best way to spark growth, and any skew toward the wealthy is mainly a reflection of the outsized amount of taxes the rich already pay. \"Even for Trump, it's hard to be different,\" said Martin Sullivan, chief economist for the nonpartisan research group Tax Analysts. \"The new flavor is a lot of tax benefits at the low end and then much more on the high end.\" With his trademark showmanship, Trump vowed to remove families making less than $50,000 from the tax rolls and allow them to send the IRS a single-page form declaring \"I win!\" Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's plan is less flamboyant but reduces rates and raises standard deductions enough to remove those families making $40,000 and under from the rolls. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, would increase the child tax credit and lower the rate for families making less than $150,000 to 15 percent. Still, Rubio would eliminate taxes on investment gains, which is how most of the affluent make most of their money, and Bush would lower top rates dramatically as well. Both of their plans are skewed to the wealthy, like Trump's, but less so. Criticism of tax proposals that benefit the wealthy grates on conservative economists. They note that the top 1 percent already pays more than a third of federal income taxes, so any large reduction would inevitably benefit them anyhow. They also argue that, by goosing the economy, the benefits from well-designed tax cuts would spread out more equitably through the economy. Still, Democrats are poised to exploit the issue. \"Each one of these candidates has a tax plan that would rip a multi-trillion-dollar hole in the federal deficit, which would likely have to be offset by cuts to programs important to the middle class, including Social Security, Medicare, infrastructure and education,\" said Eric Walker, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. \"We need a tax system that rewards work instead of just wealth.\" That sort of sound bite gnawed at Romney in 2012.

His announcement Friday is a result of the House Republican caucus\u2019s transformation into a far more conservative and Southern body than it was a generation ago. It\u2019s a shift that will most likely define the House for the foreseeable future, although it is less important in presidential primary politics than it is in Congress. Fifty years ago, the House Republicans still reflected the party\u2019s 19th-century strength in the Northeast and Midwest. But the G.O.P.\u2019s center of gravity has gradually drifted toward the South over the last few decades. Today, Republicans from the South, along with the reliably conservative interior West, vastly outnumber Republicans from the Northeast or Pacific Coast. The infusion of red-state Republicans has transformed the politics of the Republican Party. Their growing clout has made it far harder for the party to compromise or avoid crises, like the so-called  fiscal cliff, the 2013 government shutdown or the Planned Parenthood impasse of today. That\u2019s because red-state Republicans are far more conservative than their blue-state counterparts. They have been far likelier to support aggressive tactics like government shutdowns than their blue-state colleagues. In the 2013 government shutdown, red-state representatives voted against the Senate compromise to restore government funding by a 91-26 margin; Southern representatives voted against the compromise by an 85-25 margin. Conversely, the blue-state representatives voted \u201cyes,\u201d 40-26, while the Republicans from the Northeast and Pacific voted for the Senate compromise by a similar 30-15 margin. The divide was just as fierce in the fiscal cliff vote earlier in 2013, when Southern Republicans overwhelmingly opposed a deal. Mr. Boehner\u2019s Midwest was split on both bills. A similar divide can be expected on the Planned Parenthood vote, which could be particularly turbulent because evangelical Christians are so heavily concentrated in the South. And if there\u2019s a protracted fight to decide the next speaker, this divide could become crucial again. In 2013, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, went so far as to argue that the House needed \u201cred-state leadership,\u201d perhaps reflecting an awareness of the same schism evident in the data. One thing is clear: The blue-state Republicans have lost the House, and they\u2019re not getting it back anytime soon. Because of racial polarization, most Southern Republicans inhabit extremely safe districts. If anything, future Democratic gains in the House are likely to further erode the number of blue-state Republicans, just as Republican gains in the last midterm election further eroded the number of red-state Democrats. That\u2019s especially true if Democratic gains involve rolling back G.O.P. gerrymanders in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio that have tended to boost the number of relatively moderate Republicans. Mr. Boehner\u2019s resignation, however, does not end the fight of the blue-state Republicans. They have lost the House, but they will take their case to what could be surprisingly friendly terrain: the G.O.P. primary electorate. The blue-state Republicans may be a distinct minority in the House, but they still possess the delegates, voters and resources to decide the party\u2019s presidential nomination. In 2012, there were more Mitt Romney voters in California than in Texas, and in Chicago\u2019s Cook County than in West Virginia. Over all, the states that voted for President Obama in 2012 hold 50 percent of the delegates to the Republican National Convention, even though they contain just 19 percent of Republican senators. In the last two cycles, relatively moderate Republican candidates won the party\u2019s nomination by sweeping the blue states. Mr. Romney and John McCain won every Obama state in the last two primary cycles, making it all but impossible for a conservative to win the nomination. Mr. Romney lost all but one red-state primary held before Rick Santorum dropped out. The blue-state Republicans also have the advantage of superior financial resources. The blue states represented 62 percent of all Republican primary fund-raising in 2012. This isn\u2019t to say that red-state Republicans couldn\u2019t decide the party\u2019s nomination. The preponderance of elected officials are now from the red states, and they have developed a new Republican establishment \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t like to think of itself that way \u2014 of elected officials and networks of donors and operatives tied to more conservative causes than the party\u2019s waning if still wealthy Northeastern elite. If you take the view that party elites decide presidential nominations, then the growing number of red-state Republicans should open the door to more conservative candidates who ultimately win the nomination. They would have to do a better job of coordinating their influence around a single candidate than they have in the past, but they should have enough numbers to support a stronger campaign than candidates like Mr. Santorum or Mike Huckabee ever had. Yet to win, the red-state Republicans will have to persuade blue-state voters. They haven\u2019t had to do that in the House, where their numbers have been enough to force the Republican leadership to shift in their direction and to put pressure on their speaker to resign. But they won\u2019t have those same numbers at the Republican convention.", "sentences": [{"tweets": [{"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.5, "author": "alexhartzler", "tweet": "@R_Thaler Romney ;)", "clean_tweet": "Romney ;)", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1516406896/IMG_5951_crop6_normal.jpg", "followers": 472, "identifier": 650452863609634816, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "xocaducajan", "tweet": "Obama Romney #VoteObama", "clean_tweet": "Obama Romney #VoteObama", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/540798730408964096/XwK6b0VZ_normal.jpeg", "followers": 1025, "identifier": 650444252128899072, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "AntosBobbicca", "tweet": "Mitt Romney X Benedict Cumberbatch http://t.co/GSvieY57QV", "clean_tweet": "Mitt Romney X Benedict Cumberbatch", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/632639236383068164/pvlXpGBN_normal.jpg", "followers": 9, "identifier": 650448842538795008, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": true, "sentiment": 1.0, "author": "_JoelSantamaria", "tweet": "RT @WorIdStarComedy: When Mitt Romney's family spells Romney wrong. http://t.co/IOLrjuayiy", "clean_tweet": "RT When Mitt Romney's family spells Romney wrong.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/623270558495571970/sRcbFEdF_normal.jpg", "followers": 243, "identifier": 650450628062367744, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.4, "author": "hiorheymukeaf", "tweet": "RT @PresidentiaIRap: Will the real Mitt Romney please stand up  http://t.co/Evv38XO4cb", "clean_tweet": "RT Will the real Mitt Romney please stand up", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/645470566355443712/MwORTk81_normal.jpg", "followers": 1038, "identifier": 650444634053701632, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 3.8, "author": "marquitachisho2", "tweet": "RT @crystal_clanton: Mitt Romney would have been an incredible President.  https://t.co/B2GU4o5pkJ", "clean_tweet": "RT Mitt Romney would have been an incredible President.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/648178176871538688/6dO6Vkra_normal.jpg", "followers": 304, "identifier": 650454625464786944, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 4.0, "author": "bdskro77", "tweet": "@JulieBanderas Mitt Romney will make an excellent presidential President", "clean_tweet": "Mitt Romney will make an excellent presidential President", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/628774589414309888/hYga62tM_normal.jpg", "followers": 3, "identifier": 650457464408702976, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.7, "author": "palamity", "tweet": "@deray like Romney's \"binders full of women\"", "clean_tweet": "like Romney's \"binders full of women\"", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/598957654019543041/PNUsQISg_normal.jpg", "followers": 229, "identifier": 650443390874714112, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": true, "sentiment": 1.0, "author": "inartic", "tweet": "They felt sorry for Romney and McCain when they lost. https://t.co/iYS4muR5oR", "clean_tweet": "They felt sorry for Romney and McCain when they lost.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/649294551601975297/YQgP4at8_normal.jpg", "followers": 3494, "identifier": 650457647355817984, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "RhoaChri", "tweet": "Mitt Romney weighs in on 2016, says Trump \u2018will not be the nominee\u2019 http://t.co/5UvPJDtb6C", "clean_tweet": "Mitt Romney weighs in on 2016, says Trump \u2018will not be the nominee\u2019", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/650345313278922752/qkkhQyWv_normal.jpg", "followers": 5573, "identifier": 650454531868725249, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "BigLeagueTom", "tweet": "RT @elliosch: NYT editorial board hammered Romney in 2012 for warning about Russia. http://t.co/gTM5t6g47i http://t.co/1IIGzdD0R1", "clean_tweet": "RT NYT editorial board hammered Romney in 2012 for warning about Russia.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/638391813452206080/6ZuMxMy-_normal.jpg", "followers": 290, "identifier": 650445106462498816, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "buyebooksnet", "tweet": "47 Percent: Uncovering the Romney Video That Rocked the ... - http://t.co/6cpPNwzw5e #PoliticsSocialSciences http://t.co/YBeSDsqaCy", "clean_tweet": "47 Percent: Uncovering the Romney Video That Rocked the ... - #PoliticsSocialSciences", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/463279219942760448/fmHDgrFs_normal.png", "followers": 123, "identifier": 650445956693913600, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.5, "author": "MinneMike", "tweet": "@batchelorshow Romney predicted Russian invasion of Ukraine.

As with candidates like Mitt Romney and Al Gore, claims that she is inauthentic have fueled endless cycles of negative coverage of her campaign. In reality, all politicians are strategic about the image and behaviors they present to voters. Some just hide the artifice better than others. The refrain that Mrs. Clinton is calculating and inauthentic has recurred throughout her political career. During this campaign cycle, reporters and columnists have already questioned who the \u201cReal Hillary\u201d is, said that she \u201cwrestles with the authenticity issue,\u201d and described just being herself on the campaign trail as \u201ca tricky proposition.\u201d The Daily Beast\u2019s Mike Barnicle reflected the conventional wisdom in writing that the \u201cnagging question\u201d that \u201cwon\u2019t go away\u201d is \u201cWho is she? Really, who is she?\u201d Mrs. Clinton herself tries to dispel the story line. \u201cI\u2019m a real person,\u201d she said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last Sunday. The effort to showcase her personality in more comfortable settings has led to a surge in appearances in nontraditional venues, including a dance on \u201cEllen\u201d and an interview with Lena Dunham.  She is hardly the first to face this treatment. For instance, demands for the \u201creal\u201d Mitt Romney plagued him during the 2012 presidential campaign. The presumption of these claims is that politicians should reveal their true selves to us, and that those who don\u2019t have something to hide. An alternative explanation is that candidates who appear inauthentic trigger our suspicions about politicians \u2014 they don\u2019t seem to behave normally, which must mean they are up to something. But few people appear comfortable under bright lights during highly staged events; most of us would act just as awkwardly or unnaturally as Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Romney sometimes do. That behavior is likely to be a reflection of their performance skills, not a lack of authenticity. Conversely, we shouldn\u2019t assume that politicians who appear to be sincere are actually more genuine or revealing of their true selves. Like the stars you see telling scripted anecdotes on talk shows, they\u2019re often just skilled at performing their public role. As the political scientist Richard Skinner has noted, the personas of popular presidents such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy were artificial constructions. Even Joe Biden, the outgoing and expressive vice president who is widely seen as a more \u201cauthentic\u201d alternative to Mrs. Clinton, has publicly cited his family\u2019s genuine grieving over his son\u2019s death as a reason not to enter the Democratic race while privately continuing to lay the groundwork for a possible run. Recent examples illustrate how inconsistently and arbitrarily the labels of authenticity and inauthenticity are applied to candidates. Scott Walker changed a number of positions after entering the G.O.P. presidential race but generally wasn\u2019t covered as a phony, while Mr. Romney was. Jeb Bush has stuck to some unpopular stances, but isn\u2019t covered as a \u201cmaverick\u201d like John McCain. The difference may be their performance skills, not their positions. Similarly, George W. Bush and Al Gore were both born into powerful political families, but were perceived very differently. Mr. Bush successfully reinvented himself as a down-home Texas ranch owner despite being the son of a president with elite New England roots, while Mr. Gore was widely mocked as a phony who grew up amid wealth and power in Washington, especially when he invoked his childhood work on his family\u2019s Tennessee farm. Again, one simple explanation for the disparate treatment they received is that Mr. Bush was a better political performer. Once these narratives develop, candidates like Mrs. Clinton can get stuck in what I\u2019ve called the authenticity doom loop \u2014 the same fate that plagued Mr. Gore and Mr. Romney. In this phase, candidates are criticized for not being sufficiently authentic and urged to reveal their true selves. But any efforts to demonstrate authenticity prompt the news media to point out that the candidate is acting strategically and is therefore actually still inauthentic. This coverage in turn motivates further efforts to reveal the \u201creal\u201d person, and the pattern then repeats. Mrs. Clinton has gone through this cycle many times, which leads to headlines like \u201cThe Making of Hillary 5.0\u201d and \u201cRe-re-re-introducing Hillary Clinton.\u201d Consider, for instance, a recent column by The Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank, who criticized her for \u201cthe latest of many warm-and-fuzzy makeovers \u2014 perhaps the most transparent phoniness since Al Gore discovered earth tones.\u201d He calls for Mrs. Clinton to \u201cshed those who orchestrate these constant makeovers\u201d so she can \u201cbe spontaneous \u2014 and regain some semblance of her authentic self.\u201d This advice isn\u2019t likely to be any more helpful than it was when Mr. Milbank gave it to the 2012 presidential contender Tim Pawlenty (\u201cRepublicans should hope Pawlenty finds his authentic voice\u201d). Similarly, Mr. Gore and Mr. Romney tried to recalibrate their public personas to \u201cbe themselves\u201d at various points during their campaigns, but doing so did not break the cycle of harsh coverage of their performance. In the end, candidates like Mrs. Clinton who are labeled inauthentic are unlikely to change those perceptions, while the sincerity of other politicians typically goes unchallenged.

The remarks, first reported by The Washington Post, came in response to a question from a white man in a largely white crowd in Mount Pleasant, who asked how Mr. Bush planned to appeal to African-Americans. \u201cOur message is one of hope and aspiration,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t one of division and get in line and we\u2019ll take care of you with free stuff. Our message is one that is uplifting \u2014 that says you can achieve earned success.\u201d While Mr. Bush has spoken often of broadening the party\u2019s appeal, he has stumbled at times while attempting to deliver the message. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Kristy Campbell, noted that the candidate \u201ctalks constantly about the need for Republicans to reach out to all voters,\u201d though she did not directly address the reference to \u201cfree stuff.\u201d \u201cWe will never be successful in elections without communicating that conservative principles and conservative policies are the only path to restoring the right to rise for every single American,\u201d Ms. Campbell said. The Bush campaign also said that while the question posed to Mr. Bush alluded specifically to black voters, his response broadened the context to voters across the board. Mr. Bush\u2019s wording called to mind a handful of uncomfortable moments from Mr. Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. In a speech after being booed at an earlier event with the N.A.A.C.P., Mr. Romney, according to a pool report, said, \u201cYour friends who like Obamacare, you remind them of this: If they want more stuff from government, tell them to go vote for the other guy \u2014 more free stuff. But don\u2019t forget nothing is really free.\u201d And on a conference call with donors days after the election, Mr. Romney attributed his loss in part to policy \u201cgifts\u201d that the president had bestowed upon traditional Democratic constituencies, including African-Americans and Hispanics. Mr. Bush\u2019s broader message on Thursday \u2014 on the need, generally, to find ways to appeal to groups that have not been inclined to support Republicans recently \u2014 was consistent with many of his past remarks. In many ways, Mr. Bush would appear to be among the most natural bridges to African-American and Latino voters in the Republican field \u2014 a candidate with a Mexican-born wife and a history of outreach to African-Americans during his campaigns for Florida governor, at least at times. In his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Bush also made an unsubtle dig at Donald J. Trump, who recently criticized him for answering questions in Spanish. \u201cIf someone asks me a question, just for the record, don\u2019t take offense that I answer in Spanish,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an offense to you. It\u2019s a respect for others.\u201d He reiterated the need to \u201ccampaign in a way that draws people toward your cause.\u201d It is an ambition he has long grappled with, particularly with African-American voters. During a debate in 1998, Mr. Bush showed remorse when asked about his relationship with the state\u2019s black voters, who had flocked to his opponent four years earlier. \u201cRepublicans have ignored the black vote in this state, and I was part of that, and it was a mistake,\u201d Mr. Bush said. But in the early months of his run for the White House, Mr. Bush has found ways, presumably unintentionally, to alienate certain groups. Perhaps most memorably, he defended his use of the phrase \u201canchor baby\u201d by arguing it was \u201cmore related to Asian people.\u201d Hours after the comments on Thursday, the campaign highlighted his frequent discussion of the need for widespread outreach, contrasting Mr. Bush with President Obama, who the campaign said had \u201cworked to divide Americans for political gain.\u201d \u201cHis focus is on uplifting people, not dividing them,\u201d Ms. Campbell, the spokeswoman, said of Mr. Bush, \u201cand that is a message he will take across America.\u201d", "sentences": [{"tweets": [{"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.5, "author": "alexhartzler", "tweet": "@R_Thaler Romney ;)", "clean_tweet": "Romney ;)", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1516406896/IMG_5951_crop6_normal.jpg", "followers": 472, "identifier": 650452863609634816, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 3.0, "author": "xiwuraloveza", "tweet": "The truth will set you free.

Other nations were defined by their history, but America was defined by its future, by the people who weren\u2019t yet here and by the greatness that hadn\u2019t yet been achieved. American founders like Alexander Hamilton were aware that once the vast continent was settled the United States would be one of the dominant powers of the globe. There was also a religious eschatology \u2014 a belief, dating back to the Puritans, that God\u2019s plans for humanity would be completed on this continent, that America would be the \u201clast best hope of earth,\u201d as Lincoln put it. Herman Melville summarized this version of American exceptionalism in his novel \u201cWhite Jacket\u201d: \u201cThe future is endowed with such a life that it lives to us even in anticipation. \u2026 The future [is] the Bible of the free. \u2026 God has predestined, mankind expects, great things from our race; and great things we feel in our souls.\u201d Today there are some conservative commentators and Republican politicians who talk a lot about American exceptionalism. But when they use the phrase they mean the exact opposite of its original meaning. In fact, they are effectively destroying American exceptionalism. These commentators and candidates look backward to an America that is being lost. Ann Coulter encapsulated this attitude perfectly in her latest book title, \u201cAdios, America.\u201d This is the philosophy of the receding roar, the mourning for an America that once was and is now being destroyed by foreign people and ideas. Out of this backward- and inward-looking mentality comes a desire to exclude. Donald Trump talks falsely and harshly about Hispanic immigrants. Ben Carson says he couldn\u2019t advocate putting \u201ca Muslim in charge of this nation.\u201d During George W. Bush\u2019s first term there wasn\u2019t much difference between how Democrats and Republicans viewed the overall immigration levels. Republicans were about eight percentage points more likely to be dissatisfied with the contemporary immigration flows. But now the gap is an astounding 40 percentage points. Eighty-four percent of Republicans and 44 percent of Democrats are dissatisfied with the current immigration level, according to Gallup surveys. As Peter Wehner, a longtime conservative writer who served in the Bush administration, wrote in the magazine Commentary: \u201cThe message being sent to voters is this: The Republican Party is led by people who are profoundly uncomfortable with the changing (and inevitable) demographic nature of our nation. The G.O.P. is longing to return to the past and is fearful of the future. It is a party that is characterized by resentments and grievances, by distress and dismay, by the belief that America is irredeemably corrupt and past the point of no return. \u2018The American dream is dead,\u2019 in the emphatic words of Mr. Trump.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly breaking news that this is ruinous to the long-term political prospects of the party. In his book \u201c2016 and Beyond,\u201d the veteran pollster Whit Ayres, now working for Marco Rubio, points out that given the composition of the electorate, if the G.O.P. candidate won the same 59 percent share of the white vote that Mitt Romney won in 2012, he would have to win 30 percent of the nonwhite vote to get a majority. That\u2019s a daunting number, given that, as Dan Balz of The Washington Post points out, Romney only won 17 percent of that vote. But it\u2019s also bad for the spirit of conservatism. American conservatism has always been different than the conservatism found on continental Europe and elsewhere. There it was based on blood and soil, here on promise. American free market and religious conservatives have traditionally embraced a style of nationalism that is hopeful and future minded. From Lincoln to Reagan to Bush, the market has been embraced for being dynamic and progressive. The major faiths uplift in part because they are eschatological \u2014 they look forward to a glorious future. They preach an ethos of generosity and welcome. As the researcher Benjamin Knoll has found, religious parishioners of all political stripes are more likely to support more open immigration policies than others. But this hopeful nationalism is being supplanted in the G.O.P. by an anguished cry for a receding America. This pessimism isn\u2019t justified by the facts. As a definitive report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recently found, today\u2019s immigrants are assimilating as fast as previous ones. They are learning English. They are healthier than native-born Americans. Immigrant men age 18 to 39 are incarcerated at roughly one-fourth the rate of American men. Instead the pessimism grows from a sour, overgeneralized and intellectually sloppy sense of alienation. It is one thing to think Democratic policies are wrong. It is another to betray the essential American faith and take a reactionary attitude toward life. This is an attitude that sours the tongue, offends the eye and freezes the heart.", "sentences": [{"tweets": [{"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 1.9833333333333334, "author": "nancyataylor1", "tweet": "@greta why is this worse than calling Romney rich white guy?

But now we actually have a Trump tax plan, and despite his big populist talk it\u2019s actually rather\u00a0boring and predictable and (by G.O.P. standards) safe. It has some\u00a0populist elements and nationalist flourishes, but overall it\u2019s just another rate-lowering, loophole-closing reform in the style of Mitt Romney 2012 or Jeb Bush 2016, with the characteristically-implausible\u00a0promises of revenue neutrality and the typical distributional effects that you get when you promise sweeping rate reductions for the rich. (My colleague Josh Barro has a good write-up here.) As such, it\u2019s considerably less interesting and innovative than\u00a0Marco Rubio and Mike Lee\u2019s\u00a0tax plan, which for all its flaws does represent\u00a0a real\u00a0priority shift toward middle-class\u00a0parents\u00a0and away from the \u201clower the top bracket at all costs\u201d spirit, and whose supply-side elements (investment tax cuts, above all) are arguably\u00a0more pro-growth than the income-tax rate lowering that Trump prioritizes instead. Overall, Grover Norquist\u2019s description of Trump\u2019s plan as \u201cdead-center Reagan Republican tax thinking\u201d seems apt, at least if by \u201cReagan Republican\u201d you mean the version of Reaganism (the real version was more complicated) that\u2019s become right-wing orthodoxy since. There\u2019s not much new here, not much to concern the party\u2019s donor class, not much to unsettle its ideological enforcers. After all his huffing and puffing, Trump has delivered, if you\u2019ll pardon the phrase, a remarkably low-energy blueprint. As one of the reform conservatives who have been, thus far, cautiously anti-anti-Trump, I suppose I\u2019m a little relieved that a figure as grotesque as the Donald\u00a0hasn\u2019t come out with\u00a0my favorite G.O.P. tax plan of the cycle. But I\u2019m also disappointed, since it lowers the odds that Trump\u2019s populism will significant disrupt the Republican Party\u2019s\u00a0habits of mind (at least in the way I think they ought to be disrupted!), and it shoves the Trump phenomenon more in the direction of the light-on-policy white-identity politics that his harshest critics, libertarian and liberal, have identified as the essential element of his appeal. I think those critiques have been, overall, too narrow in their analysis of why Trump\u2019s rhetoric has resonated, and why he\u2019s been able to draw support from\u00a0more moderate Republican voters\u00a0as well as the party\u2019s rightward flank; as I\u2019ve said before, I think there\u2019s a legitimate class-revolt element\u00a0at work in Trump\u2019s support, albeit one that deserves a better tribune than the Donald. But if his economic plan is just Romneyism with wilder growth assumptions and some bluster about raising his own taxes\u00a0thrown in, then\u00a0he\u2019s\u00a0shifting back into a more predictable lane, and ceding a lot of the territory that a more thoroughgoingly populist right-wing candidate could hope to claim. Maybe someone else will claim it; maybe we\u2019ll get a third party candidate in this space at some point soon. But Trump himself just got a lot less interesting, and a lot more purely\u00a0toxic, than he might otherwise have been.", "sentences": [{"tweets": [{"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.7, "author": "palamity", "tweet": "@deray like Romney's \"binders full of women\"", "clean_tweet": "like Romney's \"binders full of women\"", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/598957654019543041/PNUsQISg_normal.jpg", "followers": 229, "identifier": 650443390874714112, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 3.8, "author": "marquitachisho2", "tweet": "RT @crystal_clanton: Mitt Romney would have been an incredible President.  https://t.co/B2GU4o5pkJ", "clean_tweet": "RT Mitt Romney would have been an incredible President.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/648178176871538688/6dO6Vkra_normal.jpg", "followers": 304, "identifier": 650454625464786944, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "DefendingtheUSA", "tweet": "@SandraOpines @MichelleWSC @VickyBrush @MichaelCohen212 I voted bush bush obama romney.

She said rhetoric like that is \"deeply insulting, whether it comes from Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney or Donald Trump.\" \"I think people are seeing this for what it is: Republicans lecturing people of color instead of offering real solutions to help people get ahead, including facing up to hard truths about race and justice in America,\" Clinton wrote on Facebook. Bush's remarks drew comparisons to Romney's comments following his 2012 loss in the presidential election to President Barack Obama, when the former Massachusetts governor told donors that Obama had offered \"gifts\" to minority voters. Bush told Fox News on Sunday that his comments were taken out of context and he was making a point that was counter to what Romney had said at the time. \"I think we need to make our case to African-American voters and all voters that an aspirational message, fixing a few big complex things, will allow people to rise up. That's what people want. They don't want free stuff. That was my whole point,\" Bush said.", "sentences": [{"tweets": [{"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.5, "author": "alexhartzler", "tweet": "@R_Thaler Romney ;)", "clean_tweet": "Romney ;)", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1516406896/IMG_5951_crop6_normal.jpg", "followers": 472, "identifier": 650452863609634816, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 4.0, "author": "bdskro77", "tweet": "@JulieBanderas Mitt Romney will make an excellent presidential President", "clean_tweet": "Mitt Romney will make an excellent presidential President", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/628774589414309888/hYga62tM_normal.jpg", "followers": 3, "identifier": 650457464408702976, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "xocaducajan", "tweet": "Obama Romney #VoteObama", "clean_tweet": "Obama Romney #VoteObama", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/540798730408964096/XwK6b0VZ_normal.jpeg", "followers": 1025, "identifier": 650444252128899072, "is_positive": false}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 3.8, "author": "marquitachisho2", "tweet": "RT @crystal_clanton: Mitt Romney would have been an incredible President.  https://t.co/B2GU4o5pkJ", "clean_tweet": "RT Mitt Romney would have been an incredible President.", "pimg": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/648178176871538688/6dO6Vkra_normal.jpg", "followers": 304, "identifier": 650454625464786944, "is_positive": true}, {"is_negative": false, "sentiment": 2.0, "author": "DefendingtheUSA", "tweet": "@SandraOpines @MichelleWSC @VickyBrush @MichaelCohen212 I voted bush bush obama romney.
