<h3>A note about privacy</h3>
<p>While we do encrypt passwords in our database (one-way hash), as of early summer 2015, we don't use SSL as you browse the site. This means a nasty person on your WiFi network could easily snatch your (plaintext) email, name, and password as they're being sent to our server. That's why we encourage you to use a simple password, like an English word. While our site isn't too high on a hacker's hitlist, what could damage your privacy is using your PayPal password here &mdash; please don't do that.</p>
